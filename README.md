Our project is a school database system designed to help small schools efficiently manage grades and student data without relying on messy spreadsheets. We built the platform using HTML and TypeScript, creating a simple and responsive web interface for both teachers and students. Teachers can log in to securely add, update, and view grades for each class, while students can view their performance and overall averages. The system organizes data clearly, making it easy to track progress and maintain transparency between teachers and students. Our goal was to create a user-friendly, modern alternative to traditional gradebooks thatâ€™s reliable, accessible, and tailored for smaller schools with limited technical resources.
